## Description

> GDPR-compliant: does not collect any user data

Client Viewed Invoice is a simple addon for the Sliced Invoices - Secure Invoices extension. It adds a custom column to the Invoices admin table that displays a tick icon when an invoice has been viewed via a secure link.

There are no Settings, it simply does what it says on the label.

Therefore I highly recommend installing this "Classic Editor +" plugin.

I support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/client-viewed-invoice/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue here. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.
